# About

This addon aims to provide a Keycloak-related extensions / customisations to the out-of-the-box Alfresco authentication and authorisation functionalities for the Alfresco Repository and Share tiers.

## Compatbility

All versions of this module prior to 1.2.0-rc1 are built to be compatible with Alfresco 6.0 up to 7.4. In Alfresco 7.4, the logging configuration included in those versions of the module will not be used due to a change from Log4j to Log4j2 in base Alfresco that is not reflected in the module itself.
The version 1.2.0-rc1 is built to be compatible with Alfresco 23.1 and above. In the future, a refactoring of this module is planned to re-add support of Alfresco versions lower than 23.1.
All versions of this module can be used in Alfresco Community and Enterprise.

The range of compatible Keycloak versions is difficult to specify with complete confidence due to the very active release cycle of the Keycloak project since ~2020. All versions of this module should be compatible with regards to the general authentication capability with any Keycloak version released since 2020 / Keycloak 6.0.1. Specific configuration properties, like the base authentication server URL, may change between Keycloak versions or based on the specifics of the Keycloak deployment / exposure on the network. The user and group synchronisation capability of this module may have incompatibilities between specific versions of Keycloak and specific versions of this module due to changes in the ReST API payloads. Starting with version 1.2.0-rc1 of this module, this capability explicitly ignores new properties introduced in newer Keycloak versions to improve forward compatibility.

## Features

The Repository sub-module provides a custom authentication subsystem dealing with Keycloak (separate to Alfresco's default `identity-service`) and customisations which support:

- user + password login via `AuthenticationService.authenticate` / `AuthenticationComponent.authenticate`
- `Bearer` token authentication using a client-obtained access token
- redirection to Keycloak login UI and OIDC authentication flow (SSO), if client not already authenticated in session, no pre-emptive details provided in request and API requires authentication
- mapping of person properties on authentication from user access / identity token
- mapping of authorities from user access token (for purpose of permission / role checks)
- handling Keycloak back-channel requests
    - back-channel logout requests from Keycloak (i.e. SSO including "single sign-out")
    - bulk-invalidation of access tokens issued before a certain point in time
    - availability test / basic validation
    - JWKS (public key) update
- active user / group synchronisation against Keycloak's directory (which may include users / groups synchronised from multiple federated directories)
- Java service, JavaScript service and web script to expose roles mapped from Keycloak for retrieval (e.g. to be used in permission management)

The Share sub-module provides a Keycloak-based filter and customisations that support:

- redirection to Keycloak login UI and OIDC authentication flow (SSO), if client not already authenticated in session, no pre-emptive details provided in request and SSO authentication required/enforced via configuration
- enhancement of the login dialog to allow users to perform an alternative, external authentication via Keycloak
- handling Keycloak back-channel requests
    - back-channel logout requests from Keycloak (i.e. SSO including "single sign-out")
    - bulk-invalidation of access tokens issued before a certain point in time
    - availability test / basic validation
    - JWKS (public key) update
- Share logout action triggering a Keycloak logout (logging user out of other applications handled by Keycloak if those support Keycloak back-channel logout requests)
- [RFC 8693 OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693) (a [preview functionality in Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_token-exchange) to properly delegate the Share-tier authentication to the Repository, if signed on via Keycloak SSO

All authentication functionality of this addon is based on OpenID Connect. Though Keycloak does support SAML clients, no support was implemented to have Alfresco act as a SAML client against Keycloak as an alternative to OpenID Connect client behaviour.

# Configuration

The configuration of both the Keycloak server and this module offer a large number of properties to adjust, and various modes of operation. Therefore, the following sub-documents have been created to provide details and guides:

- [Getting Started (Simple Configuration)](./docs/Simple-Configuration.md)
- Repository Configuration Reference
    - [Keycloak Subsystem](./docs/Reference-Repository-Subsystem.md)
    - [Keycloak Adapter](./docs/Reference-Adapter.md)
    - [Extension API](./docs/Reference-Repository-Extension.md)
- [Share Configuration Reference](./docs/Reference-Repository.md)

# Build

This project uses a Maven build using templates from the [Acosix Alfresco Maven](https://github.com/Acosix/alfresco-maven) project and produces module AMPs, regular Java *classes* JARs, JavaDoc and source attachment JARs, as well as installable (Simple Alfresco Module) JAR artifacts for the Alfresco Content Services and Share extensions. If the installable JAR artifacts are used for installing this module, developers / users are advised to consult the 'Dependencies' section of this README.

A simple build of this project can be executed by running:

```
mvn install
```

Since version 1.2.0-rc1 this project includes a sub-module that - when executed - starts up a local Alfresco + Keycloak stack for running user interaction tests and (in the future) integration tests. This sub-module is optionally enabled by using a Maven profile. A build starting such a stack without installing or publishing artifacts can be executed by running:

```
mvn integration-test -P dockerTest
```

or just running

```
mvn integration-test
```

in the `docker-test` sub-module directly. The Alfresco + Keycloak stack started that way will remain up and running until the `clean` target is executed on the project while the `tareget/classes/docker-compose.yaml` file is present in the sub-module. A run with the `clean` target will only stop the stack - in order to remove all persistent data and the images built for the stack, the `clean` target must be run with the additional profile `purge`.

Running the Alfresco + Keycloak stack with the `docker-test` sub-module requires the presence of a Toolchain that provides a path where the `docker` binary can be found. The locally installed Docker versions also needs to support Docker Compose v2.

## Maven toolchains

By inheritance from the Acosix Alfresco Maven framework, this project uses the [Maven Toolchains plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/) to allow potential cross-compilation against different Java versions. This plugin is used to avoid potentially inconsistent compiler and library versions compared to when only the source/target compiler options of the Maven compiler plugin are set, which (as an example) has caused issues with some Alfresco releases in the past where Alfresco compiled for Java 7 using the Java 8 libraries.
In order to build the project it is necessary to provide a basic toolchain configuration via the user specific Maven configuration home (usually ~/.m2/). That file (toolchains.xml) needs to list the path to a compatible JDK for the Java version required by this project (JDK 17) and Docker CLI tools in case the sub-module `docker-test` is to be executed to run a local Alfresco + Keycloak stack. The following is a sample file defining a Java 11 and 17 development kit as well as paths to those Docker CLI tools.

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<toolchains xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/TOOLCHAINS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/TOOLCHAINS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/toolchains-1.1.0.xsd">

        <path>C:\Program Files\Docker\cli-plugins</path>
      </paths>
    </configuration>
  </toolchain>
</toolchains>
```

The master branch requires Java 8.

## Docker-based integration tests

In a default build using ```mvn clean install```, this project will build the extension for Alfresco Content Services, executing regular unit-tests without running integration tests. The integration tests of this project are based on Docker and require a Docker engine to run the necessary components (PostgreSQL database as well as Alfresco Content Services). Since a Docker engine may not be available in all environments of interested community members / collaborators, the integration tests have been made optional. A full build, including integration tests, can be run by executing

```
mvn clean install -Ddocker.tests.enabled=true
```

This project currently does not yet contain any specific integration tests but does use integration tests to verify Alfresco correctly starts up with the addon installed.

## Dependencies

This module depends on the following projects / libraries:

- various [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) adapter and client libraries (Apache License, Version 2.0)
    - keycloak-adapter-core
    - keycloak-servlet-adapter-spi
    - keycloak-servlet-filter-adapter
    - keycloak-authz-client
- [JBoss Logging](https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logging) (Apache License, Version 2.0)
- Acosix Alfresco Utility (Apache License, Version 2.0) - core extension

All Keycloak and JBoss dependencies are aggregated (shaded) directly into the module library for Repository and Share respectively. This has been done to isolate this addon from whatever version of Keycloak libraries Alfresco pre-packages to support its `identity-service` authentication subsystem.

The Acosix Alfresco Utility project provides the core extension for Alfresco Content Services as a separate artifact from the full module, which needs to be installed in Alfresco Content Services before the AMP of this project can be installed.

When the installable JAR produced by the build of this project is used for installation, the developer / user is responsible to either manually install all the required components / libraries provided by the listed projects, or use a build system to collect all relevant direct / transitive dependencies.
**Note**: The Acosix Alfresco Utility project is also built using templates from the Acosix Alfresco Maven project, and as such produces similar artifacts. Automatic resolution and collection of (transitive) dependencies using Maven / Gradle will resolve the Java *classes* JAR as a dependency, and **not** the installable (Simple Alfresco Module) variant. It is recommended to exclude Acosix Alfresco Utility from transitive resolution and instead include it directly / explicitly.

## Using SNAPSHOT builds

In order to use a pre-built SNAPSHOT artifact published to the Open Source Sonatype Repository Hosting site, the artifact repository may need to be added to the POM, global settings.xml or an artifact repository proxy server. The following is the XML snippet for inclusion in a POM file.

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
